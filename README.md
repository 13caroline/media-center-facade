Platform of a media center for sharing music/videos (media) in an apartment.
The design and development of the application should follow a UML-supported approach, according to the phased delivery process. The application should be developed using a multi-layer architecture and object-oriented technologies (Java). ([Technical report](https://github.com/13caroline/DSS/blob/master/relatorioDSS.pdf))

## Phase 1: Requirements Analysis
* Domain Model with relevant entities
* Use Case model with the proposed features
* Use Case Specification
* Prototype of the proposed interface 

## Phase 2: Solution's Conceptual Modeling
* A conceptual system architecture, capable of supporting the defined Use Case set
* Behavioral modeling of the methods needed to implement these Use Case
* First experimental implementation of some relevant Use Case 

## Phase 3: Solution Implementation

* The architectural and behavioral models, specified at the implementation level, necessary to implement the Use Case subset
* The implementation of the referred Use Case 

__Keywords__: Java, UML, Use Case model, Domain model
